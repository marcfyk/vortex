# Vortex

Solutions for [Fly.io's distributed systems challenges](https://fly.io/dist-sys/)
that run on [Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom).


The crate builds different binaries for each challenge, 
with the common maelstrom functionality shared between binaries in the crate library.
